# This is the nebula example configuration file. You must edit, at a minimum, the static_host_map, lighthouse, and firewall sections
# Some options in this file are HUPable, including the pki section. (A HUP will reload credentials from disk without affecting existing tunnels)

# PKI defines the location of credentials for this node. Each of these can also be inlined by using the yaml ": |" syntax.
pki:
  # The CAs that are accepted by this node. Must contain one or more certificates created by 'nebula-cert ca'
  ca: /opt/nebula/certs/ca.crt

# The static host map defines a set of hosts with fixed IP addresses on the internet (or any network).
# A host can have multiple fixed IP addresses defined here, and nebula will try each when establishing a tunnel.
# The syntax is:
#   "{nebula ip}": ["{routable ip/dns name}:{routable port}"]
# Example, if your lighthouse has the nebula IP of 192.168.100.1 and has the real ip address of 100.64.22.11 and runs on port 4242:
static_host_map:

  # remote_allow_list allows you to control ip ranges that this node will
  # consider when handshaking to another node. By default, any remote IPs are
  # allowed. You can provide CIDRs here with `true` to allow and `false` to
  # deny. The most specific CIDR rule applies to each remote. If all rules are
  # "allow", the default will be "deny", and vice-versa. If both "allow" and
  # "deny" rules are present, then you MUST set a rule for "0.0.0.0/0" as the
  # default.

  # local_allow_list allows you to filter which local IP addresses we advertise
  # to the lighthouses. This uses the same logic as `remote_allow_list`, but
  # additionally, you can specify an `interfaces` map of regular expressions
  # to match against interface names. The regexp must match the entire name.
  # All interface rules must be either true or false (and the default will be
  # the inverse). CIDR rules are matched after interface name rules.
  # Default is all local IP addresses.
